## Worklog — Private HS Consultant (Static MVP)

2025-10-03
- Scaffolded repo structure per spec: `public/`, `assets/doc/`, `netlify/functions/`, `data/`.
- Implemented index page with hero CTA and injected content from `assets/doc/index.txt`.
- Implemented survey page with Netlify Forms wiring (honeypot + hidden `form-name`).
- Added optional function path (disabled by default) via `data-use-function` form attribute.
- Wrote `append-csv` Netlify Function to append sanitized rows to GitHub CSV using env vars.
- Added responsive, accessible styles and light JS for content injection + optional function submit.
- Added Netlify config with publish dir and redirects.
- Authored README and AGENTS for setup and operations.

Next Steps
- Implement “Generate Report” flow (currently disabled placeholder).
- Consider adding simple client-side summary render after submit.
- If moving to a DB later, mirror CSV columns to DB schema; provide an admin export.
